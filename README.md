ShadowFox Data Science Internship â€“ June 2025

This repository contains the work completed during my 1-month virtual Data Science Internship with ShadowFox. The internship focused on strengthening core skills in Python programming, data analysis, and visualization.

During the internship, I gained hands-on experience with real-world datasets, practiced using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly, and learned how to document and present insights effectively.
